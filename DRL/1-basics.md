# Deep Reinforcement Learning Basics

## Definition
Deep Reinforcement Learning is combination of *Reinforcement Learning* and *Deep Learning*. The machine learning are divided into three categories
* **Supervised Learning**: Each training data unit contains a *label* which tells the correct answer to the problem The model is trained to approach
* **Unsupervised Learning**: The training data do not contain the label. The algorithm has to learn a structure from the data by himself.
* **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: RL is something in between. We only know the answer at the end of a sequence of actions.  But these actions all have influence on the final outcome.
